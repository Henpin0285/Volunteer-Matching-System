# Volunteer-Matching-System
Project Title: Volunteer Matching System

Description:
The Volunteer Matching System is a Python project designed for the Foster Farm Family House to streamline the process of matching volunteers with tasks based on their skills and availability. The system utilizes a simple algorithm that takes into account the required skills for each task and the volunteer's availability. It can be deployed in various settings, such as non-profit organizations, community events, or any scenario where volunteers need to be efficiently assigned to tasks.

Key Features:

Volunteer and Task Classes: Defines classes for volunteers and tasks, encapsulating relevant information.
Matching Algorithm: Employs a matching algorithm to pair volunteers with tasks based on skill compatibility and availability.
Web Application (optional): The project includes the potential for deployment as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input volunteer data and view matching results through a user-friendly interface.
How to Use:

Input volunteer information, including name, skills, and availability.
Define tasks with required skills and schedules.
Run the matching algorithm to find optimal volunteer-task matches.
Optionally, deploy the system as a web application for a more interactive experience.
Technologies:

Python
Flask (for web deployment, optional)
